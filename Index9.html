Dear Reader,<br>

<p>In these extremely challenging times, I would like to share our heartfelt support and solidarity with you and your families. At Vsco Ltd , the health and safety of our colleagues, customers, partners and the communities in which we operate is our number one priority. We have a 125-year legacy of responsible business and we are committed to doing all we can to keep everyone safe.

As governments around the world are implementing measures to contain this public health crisis, we have been taking strict precautions to protect our colleagues and their families, while securing customer service. Our business is considered essential during times of crisis as we are part of the global food chain, as well as a critical player in public health and hygiene. Our sites around the world are fully operational, and our production and delivery secured. Furthermore, we have extensive contingency plans in place securing our supply chain and ongoing business.

We are following the advice of all governments and public health authorities, and proactively implementing a range of precautionary measures, from stringent sanitation and cleaning protocols, to workplace distancing, global temperature checks and a worldwide travel ban. To best protect those who must be at a Firmenich facility to carry out their work, the majority of our colleagues are working from home.

We are extremely proud of and grateful to our teams who come on site every day to ensure business continuity. On top of our global precautions, we have taken significant steps to safeguard and support them, from operating split shifts in plants and laboratories to minimize exposure, to providing special arrangements for childcare, transportation and accommodation where necessary. Our measures are aligned with World Health Organization guidelines and local health officials, and we continue to adjust our approach as necessary.

We will keep you informed as the situation evolves and thank you for your continued trust.</p>

Warm Regards,<br>

Caroline Amuge <br>
General Secretary  <br>
