Dear Clients,<br>
On behalf of Vsco Ltd, I’d like to invite you to join us as a sponsor for the upcoming fashion show in Adjumani, Miss West Nile 2020/21. This event is a fantastic chance to join us in highlighting emerging fashion trends from around the world, and will allow you to promote your brand to fashion-minded individuals and press in Adjumani.
Vsco Ltd is an experience fashion show organizer, and this year we are committed to making Miss West Nile not just the years’ most successful show, but our greatest show ever. To accomplish the task, we need help from supportive sponsors like Miss Madi Foundation, Good Shepard Ltd, Centenary Bank, etc
In return for your generous financial support of Vsco Ltd we will promote your brand in our marketing campaigns, promotional materials, during the show, and in post-show communications. These promotions will benefit you by increasing brand awareness amongst a target audience of thousands.
I greatly appreciate you taking the time to review our sponsorship proposal. As always, our success depends on partnership with brands like yours, and we are proud to have served as a valuable marketing partner for years. Should you have any questions, comments, or concerns, I encourage you to reach out to me directly at Sender. Email.
